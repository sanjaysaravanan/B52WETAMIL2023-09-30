  Object DataType: key value pairs

  Mapping Techniques:
    to keep a record of some key value pairs

    removing duplicates
    frequency of characters

  Algorithms:
    1. Searching
    2. Largest of an array
    3. Smallest of an array
    5. Frequency of char, removal of duplicates, removal of specific characters

    isNaN() --> return false if the string is Number, else true

Questions:
  1. Given 2 numbers N and K followed by N elements,print the number of repetition of K otherwise print '-1' if the element not found.
      Sample Testcase :
      INPUT
      6 2
      1 2 3 5 7 8
      OUTPUT
      0

      N=6, K=2
      arr=[1,2,3,5,7,8]

      userInput = ['6 2', '1 2 3 5 7 8'];

  2. The area of an equilateral triangle is ¼(√3a2) where "a" represents a side of the triangle. You are provided with the side "a". Find the area of the equilateral triangle.

  ((Math.sqrt(3) * (a * a)) / 4).toFixed(2)

  3. You are provided with a number "N", Find the Nth term of the series: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, ....... 
    I/P: 11
    O/P: 
  
  4. You are given the coefficients of a quadratic equation in order A, B & C.
    Where A is the coefficient of X2,  B is the coefficient of X and C is the constant term in the most simplified form.
    Example: For  X2 + 5X + 6 = 0, you are given the input as: 1 5 6.
    Write a program to find all of the roots of the quadratic.
    Note: The output should be up to 2nd decimal place (round off if needed) and in case of a recurring decimal use braces i.e. for eg: 0.33333..... => 0.33.
    Note: Use Shri Dharacharya's Method to solve i.e. X = {-b + √(b² - 4ac) } / 2a & {-b-√(b² -4ac)} / 2a

    (-b + Math.sqrt(((b*b) - (4 * a * c))))/ ( 2 * a )
    (-b - Math.sqrt(((b*b) - (4 * a * c))))/ ( 2 * a )
  
    5. You are given a number with duplicate digits your task is to remove the immediate duplicate digits and print the result

      Input Description:
      You are given a long string of digits

      Output Description:
      Print the desired result print -1 if result length is 0

      Sample Input :
      1331
      Sample Output :
      11
  
  6. I/P: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,1]
